## About ReAnim8or
A project I started when I was on vacation. The goal is to re-create some of the simple
editing capabilities of [Anim8or](http://anim8or.com/main/index.html). Steve, sadly,
never open sourced the original client.

### Live Demo
You can see a live demo of whatever I consider "stable" here:
